## Terminology

### Moves

There is a difference between possible moves: Attacked squares are all squares that are in the attacking view of a piece. These are both legal and illegal moves. For example a piece can threaten the opposite color king even if it is pinned (it can threaten the opponents king even if it could not legally have gone to that square, for example if that would have set its own king in check).
